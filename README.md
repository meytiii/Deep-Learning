# Deep Learning Examples and Resources

Welcome to the Deep Learning Examples and Resources repository! This repository is dedicated to providing practical examples and resources to help you understand and implement deep learning concepts using popular libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where artificial neural networks, inspired by the human brain's structure and function, learn from large amounts of data to perform tasks without explicit programming. It has revolutionized various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.

## Libraries

### TensorFlow

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Google. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources to build and deploy machine learning models efficiently.

### PyTorch

[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is another popular open-source deep learning framework known for its flexibility and ease of use. Developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR), PyTorch offers dynamic computation graphs and a seamless integration with Python, making it a favorite among researchers and practitioners.

## Examples

Explore practical examples to get hands-on experience with deep learning concepts:

### 1. Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
